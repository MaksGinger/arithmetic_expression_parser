# arithmetic_expression_parser
This program may parse arithmetic expression written in infix, prefix or postfix notation form to the binary tree(formula tree).

It was my assignment in the course on data structures. Program is Windows Forms App with Textbox which requires to be inputted with arithmetic expression in infix, prefix or postfix notation forms. It translates postfix and infix notation forms to prefix and then builds up the binary tree of the inputted arithmetic expression.
